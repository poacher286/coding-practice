     * You are given an integer array cost of size n. You are currently at position n (at the end of the line) in a line of n + 1 people (numbered from 0 to n).
     *
     * You wish to move forward in the line, but each person in front of you charges a specific amount to swap places. The cost to swap with person i is given by cost[i].
     *
     * You are allowed to swap places with people as follows:
     *
     * If they are in front of you, you must pay them cost[i] to swap with them.
     * If they are behind you, they can swap with you for free.
     * Return an array answer of size n, where answer[i] is the minimum total cost to reach each position i in the line.
     *
     * Â 
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: cost = [5,3,4,1,3,2]
     *
     * Output: [5,3,3,1,1,1]
     *
     * Explanation:
     *
     * We can get to each position in the following way:
     *
     * i = 0. We can swap with person 0 for a cost of 5.
     * i = 1. We can swap with person 1 for a cost of 3.
     * i = 2. We can swap with person 1 for a cost of 3, then swap with person 2 for free.
     * i = 3. We can swap with person 3 for a cost of 1.
     * i = 4. We can swap with person 3 for a cost of 1, then swap with person 4 for free.
     * i = 5. We can swap with person 3 for a cost of 1, then swap with person 5 for free.
     * @param cost
     * @return
