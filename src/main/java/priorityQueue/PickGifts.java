    /**
     * You are given an integer array gifts denoting the number of gifts in various piles. Every second, you do the following:
     *
     * Choose the pile with the maximum number of gifts.
     * If there is more than one pile with the maximum number of gifts, choose any.
     * Leave behind the floor of the square root of the number of gifts in the pile. Take the rest of the gifts.
     * Return the number of gifts remaining after k seconds.
     *
     *
     *
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: gifts = [25,64,9,4,100], k = 4
     * Output: 29
     * Explanation:
     * The gifts are taken in the following way:
     * - In the first second, the last pile is chosen and 10 gifts are left behind.
     * - Then the second pile is chosen and 8 gifts are left behind.
     * - After that the first pile is chosen and 5 gifts are left behind.
     * - Finally, the last pile is chosen again and 3 gifts are left behind.
     * The final remaining gifts are [5,8,9,4,3], so the total number of gifts remaining is 29.
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: gifts = [1,1,1,1], k = 4
     * Output: 4
     * Explanation:
     * In this case, regardless which pile you choose, you have to leave behind 1 gift in each pile.
     * That is, you can't take any pile with you.
     * So, the total gifts remaining are 4.
